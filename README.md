Thanks for the extra info! While I can't pull your GitHub stats or pinned repos automatically, I can set up the README to include all the sections you might want, with ready-to-use widgets and placeholders. You can easily update your stats or adjust pinned projects later if you’d like.

Here’s a personalized, standout profile README draft for you. Let me know if you want to tweak anything!
